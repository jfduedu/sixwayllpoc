# Creating BaseRoom objects, each with a name and description
# BaseRooms have pointers in 6 cardinal directions (custom enum) to other BaseRooms
# Inside the program literally just type 0 to move to the next room and that's it
# Haven't added a recursive input function yet to continue playing its just one and done for now

# Current Layout
